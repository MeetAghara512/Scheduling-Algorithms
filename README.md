# ðŸš€ Task Algo - Advanced Scheduling Algorithm Visualization

Tired of manually analyzing scheduling algorithms? **Task Algo** is your solution for visualizing and comparing scheduling techniques like FCFS, SJF, Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin. Designed for students, educators, and professionals, Task Algo brings scheduling algorithms to life with interactive Gantt charts and smooth animations.

## ðŸ”¥ Key Features - What Task Algo Can Do for You

- âœ… **Multi-Algorithm Support:** Visualize First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Round Robin (RR), Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling, and Preemptive Priority Scheduling.
- âœ… **Dynamic Gantt Charts:** Watch real-time execution of scheduling algorithms with smooth transitions.
- âœ… **Idle Time Representation:** Clearly view idle periods when no process is executing.
- âœ… **Interactive Controls:** Adjust process arrival times, priorities, and burst times with ease.
- âœ… **Process Metrics:** Compare Process based on turnaround time, waiting time, and response time.

## ðŸ§  How Task Algo Works - Powered by React & Tailwind CSS

### ðŸ“Š Gantt Chart Visualization - See Scheduling in Action
- **Dynamic Process Handling:** Processes enter and leave based on scheduling policies.
- **Idle Time Display:** Highlights CPU idle times for accurate scheduling representation.
- **Smooth Animations:** CSS-powered animations provide a seamless experience.

### ðŸŽ› User Inputs - Customize Your Scheduling Scenario
- **Process Addition:** Define process arrival time, burst time, and priority.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Switch between FCFS, SJF (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive), Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, Multi-Level Queue, and Multi-Level Feedback Queue.
- **Time Quantum Adjustment:** Configure time slices for Round Robin.
